## üîë Key Concepts Implemented

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating, updating, and deleting HTML elements using JavaScript to reflect the current state of the task list.
* **Event Handling:** Using `addEventListener` to manage user interactions like clicks and keyboard inputs.
* **State Management:** Maintaining the application's state in a single JavaScript array (`todos`) and re-rendering the UI whenever the state changes.
* **Local Storage:** Utilizing the browser's `localStorage` API to persist data across sessions, providing a seamless user experience.
* **Accessibility:** Using semantic HTML and `aria-label` attributes to ensure the application is usable by screen readers.
