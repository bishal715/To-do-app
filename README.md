This project was a practical exercise in building a modern, interactive single-page application using core web technologies. My goal was to create a responsive and user-friendly task manager that could handle dynamic data and persist user sessions.

For the structure, I used HTML5, employing semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, and <ul> to create a logical and accessible document outline. I leveraged the data-* attribute to manage the state of the task filters, providing a clean way to link the UI to my JavaScript logic. Crucially, I also addressed accessibility by adding an aria-label to the icon-only button, ensuring that screen readers could interpret its function as "Add task."

To style the application, I utilized CSS3, starting with custom properties (variables) for the color scheme, which made the design system maintainable and easy to modify. I relied heavily on Flexbox to create a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. To enhance the user experience, I implemented smooth transition effects on interactive elements like buttons and list items. Advanced selectors and pseudo-classes such as :hover and :checked were used to provide immediate visual feedback, for example, by changing button colors or showing a strikethrough on completed tasks.

The application's dynamic functionality was powered entirely by JavaScript. I practiced extensive DOM manipulation to add, update, and delete tasks without reloading the page. All user actions, from button clicks to keyboard inputs, were handled through addEventListener. The core of the app was a single state array (todos), which I manipulated using modern methods like .map() and .filter() to toggle completion status or clear completed tasks. Finally, to ensure data persistence, I used the localStorage API, allowing users to close their browser and return to their saved list of tasks.
